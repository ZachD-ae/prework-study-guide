# Prework Study Guide

## Description

- My motivation for this project and all going forward is push past my comfortibility level and truly master the techinqiues taught to me. 
- I built this project to finally take the first step in learning how to code and how different languages work together. 
- The problems that I found arose the most, where very simple things such as a typo here or there. Also connecting and navigating the CLI was difficult at first but eventaully I was able to figure it out by looking at it, from a logical standpoint and seeing how the computer was talking.
- To take a breath, read thoroughly, and be patient. Although everything at first was super confusing, when I wpould look back and read it again, I could understand what was happening.
